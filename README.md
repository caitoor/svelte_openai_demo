# Svelte + OpenAI API Demo App

## How to run the app

- Clone the repository.
- Duplicate the `.env.example` file in the root directory and rename it to `.env.`
- Insert your OpenAI API key into the `.env` file and save it.
- Open a terminal, navigate to the directory, and execute the following commands:
  
```
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

## Disclaimer

It is very unsafe to run an app like this and your OpenAI key becomes more or less accessible to the public. While this is very generous to other people, you might consider writing a proxy server to conceal your API key in production environments.
